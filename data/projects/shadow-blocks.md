# Shadow Blocks

This was one of the many assignments I have done in university, for the subject Object Oriented Software Development. The goal of the assignment is to create a clone 'Sokoban' game with an informal competition to extend the game as creative as possible. This project won first place in the creativity competition!

## Technical Specs

The game was written in Java using the Slick2D library. The goal of the assignment was to demonstrate good object oriented programming principles and general good programming practices. This game was built in a span of three weeks.
