# DueDate

This was submitted for the university subject Web Information Technologies.

A proof of concept web application written in NodeJS. Helps reduce food waste by managing what is inside your fridge! Manage shopping lists, fridge lists, and create a better future for the planet by generating less food waste.

This is the very first full Angular application I have written with my peers: Farhan Darma, Manindra Arora. The application is developed using the MEAN stack. 

## Features

- Keep a list of items in your fridge and keep track of (approximate) expiry dates.
- Manage shopping list and recipes. Know which items to buy and not buy in a recipe.
- Reduce food waste overall.

## My role

- Adopting Angular and TypeScript.
- Setting up Heroku CD from Git.
- Creating and designing the MongoDB database and the backend structure.
- Setting up Angular services to connect to the backend.
- Some front-end design and introducing component-based design to the team.
