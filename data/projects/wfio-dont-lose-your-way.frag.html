        <p>Don't Lose Your Way (DLYW, for short) is an Android application targeted to elders
        that may require assistance in navigating from point A to point B. The application
        is rich of accessibility features, such as AR navigation to help navigate Elders
        where to go and a carer-on-demand service to allow a registered loved-one assist
        in navigating through voice or text chat.</p>
        <p>This is originally a capstone project for the subject IT Project in University of
        Melbourne. Done by team "We'll Figure it Out":</p>
