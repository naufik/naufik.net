    A proof of concept web application written in NodeJS. Helps reduce food waste by managing what is inside your fridge! Manage shopping lists, fridge lists, and create a better future for the planet by generating less food waste.
</p>
<p>
    This is probably the very first full Angular application I have written
    with my peers: Farhan Darma, Manindra Arora. The application is developed
    using the MEAN stack.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Features</strong>:
    <ul>
        <li>Keep a list of what things are in your fridge, and keep track of their expiry dates.</li>
        <li>Manage shopping list and recipes! Know which items to NOT buy in your recipe.</li>
        <li>Reduce food waste overall.</li>
    </ul>
