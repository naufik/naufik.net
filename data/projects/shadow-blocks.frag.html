<h3> A Haskell Remake</h3>
<p>
    I attempted a Haskell Remake for this game. However this ended up being too
    complex (mainly due to conventions of the graphic library) and is currently
    unmaintained. The future status of the Haskell remake is unknown, I have
    only made it as far as moving the characters around.
