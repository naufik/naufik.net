Don't Lose Your Way (DLYW, for short) is an Android application targeted to elders that may require assistance in navigating from point A to point B. The application is rich of accessibility features, such as AR navigation to help navigate Elders where to go and a carer-on-demand service to allow a registered loved-one assist in navigating through voice or text chat.

This is originally a capstone project for the subject IT Project in University of Melbourne. Done by team "We'll Figure it Out":

- Naufal Fikri (me)
- Farhan Darma
- Nicola Halim
- Samuel Tumewa
- Surviantoro Ilham
