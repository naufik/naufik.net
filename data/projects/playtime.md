 # Playtime
 
 Playtime is a simple to-do-list app that allows you to stop productivity-blocking applications from launching unless you finish your task (of course there is a honesty factor). This is the oldest recoverable programming project I have done, dating back to 2013 as a submission for the IB MYP Personal Project.

 PlayTime is written in C# and the .NET Framework for Windows. It uses the Process API in the .NET Framework for Windows, allowing programs to kill other programs. A test in Windows 10 at Jan 2018 seems to hint that the kill-other-programs functionality does not work for all applications. 

## Features

- Basic anti-procrastination to-do list. Blocks games before you finish tasks.
- Beautiful ahead-of-its time custom WPF GUI.
- Drag-and-drop interface to add blocked applications that works on shortcuts too!
