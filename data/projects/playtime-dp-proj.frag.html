<p>
    Playtime is a simple to-do-list app that allows you to stop productivity-blocking
    applications from launching unless you finish your task (of course there is
    a honesty factor). This is the oldest recoverable programming project I have
    done, dating back to 2013 as a submission for the IB MYP Personal Project.

<h3>Features</h3>
<p>
    <ul>
        <li>Basic anti-procrastination to-do list. Blocks games before you finish tasks.</li>
        <li>Beautiful ahead-of-its time custom WPF GUI.</li>
        <li>Drag-and-drop interface to add blocked applications that works
            on shortcuts too!
        </li>
    </ul>
</p>
<h3>Technical Specs</h3>
<p>
    PlayTime is written in C# and the .NET Framework for Windows. It uses the 
    Process API in the .NET Framework for Windows, allowing programs
    to kill other programs. A test in Windows 10 at Jan 2018 seems to hint
    that the kill-other-programs functionality does not work for all applications.
