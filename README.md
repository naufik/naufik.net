# Personal Website

My personal website. Powered by React and NextJS (static site generator, rather than server-side renderer).

This replaces [the old website](https://github.com/naufik/old-naufik.net) powered by Angular. I just think that a static website is much more appropriate for what is my personal website. Client-side renderers are just not cutting it for me anymore in terms of performance and/or clunkiness.

Angular especially is getting out of hand in terms of difficulty and speed of updates..

## Directory

Follows regular NextJS conventions.

TODO: add where the blog and projects file is...

## TODOs

- Move content from https://naufik.net to this repo. Including images and project pages (S3 bucket)
- Github actions for CI/CD, I'm assuming we will use FTP for this
