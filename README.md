# Personal Website

My personal website. Powered by React and NextJS (static site generator, rather than server-side renderer).

This replaces [the old website](https://github.com/naufik/old-naufik.net) powered by Angular. I just think that a static website is much more appropriate for what is my personal website. Client-side renderers are just not cutting it for me anymore in terms of performance and/or clunkiness.

Angular especially is getting out of hand in terms of difficulty and speed of updates..

Follows regular NextJS conventions.
